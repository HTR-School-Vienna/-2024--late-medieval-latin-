## Transcription guidelines
The guidelines followed are those prescribed by [CATMuS (Consistent Approaches for Transcribing Manuscripts)](https://catmus-guidelines.github.io/). [Ariane Pinche, Thibault Clérice, Alix Chagué, Jean-Baptiste Camps, Malamatenia Vlachou- Efstathiou, et al., CATMuS-Medieval: Consistent Approaches to Transcribing ManuScripts: A generalized set of guidelines and models for Latin scripts from Middle Ages (8th–16th century). 2023. hal-04346939]

Due to the level of complexity in the manuscripts studied, significant interpretation of the guidelines was required. It was necessary to agree on general conventions in order to produce a consistent approach in transcribing; nevertheless, some minor variation will be found based on individual interpretation.
